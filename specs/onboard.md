## Joining our Team - Values and Code of Conduct
To join our team, new members must first review our team contract. The contract details important details about our team, including our primary means of communication, when and how meetings are scheduled, and a list of our core conduct and values. These values include academic integrity, teamwork, enjoyment, and respect. These values are also explained in the team Wiki. Note that the details of communication and meeting scheduling are subject to change. Hoever, our core values and conduct will remain unless all memebers agree to a change. New members must review the contract. Then, they must sign and date it. The signature represents an agreement to folowing the rules for meetings and communication, and, more importantly, upholding the values listed in the contract. After having their signature appaorved and their signed contract added to the repo, they are officially a part of the team.

To contribute to the project, a member must follow a series of steps.
1. They must first communicate to the team the general idea for either a new feature, refactoring, or a bug fix.
2. Then, the memember should create an issue following the template for their specific change: the feature template for a new feature, the big fix template for a bug fix, and the refactoring template for refactoring the code. Then, their filled out issue should be approved by either a team lead or one other memeber of the development team.
3. Next, the memember should add the appropriate labels.
